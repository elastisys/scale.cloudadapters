/**
 * A {@link CloudPool} is a management interface towards an elastic pool of
 * machines for a particular cloud provider, handling communication with the
 * cloud provider according to its API. The {@link CloudPool} provides a
 * cloud-neutral API to clients, such as the autoscaler, with a number of
 * management primitives for the machine pool. In general terms, these
 * primitives allow clients to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>track the machine pool members and their states</li>
 * <li>modify the size of the machine pool (the cloud pool continuously
 * starts/stops machine instances so that the number of machines in the pool
 * matches the desired size set for the pool)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * A {@link CloudPool} instance is intended to be made network-accessible by a
 * {@link CloudPoolRestApi} REST endpoint, which exposes the {@link CloudPool}
 * through the
 * <a href="http://cloudpoolrestapi.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">elastisys:scale
 * cloud pool REST API</a>).
 * <p/>
 * Implementors should take measures to ensure that implementations are
 * thread-safe, since they may be called by several concurrent threads.
